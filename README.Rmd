> Support R-:package: for paper Ver√≠ssimo et al. (2020)

This package contains all methods and workflow necessary to reproduce the results in the paper using the vignettes in the folder with the same name:

* `Analysis.Rmd`: Choosing an alpha value and a target number of variables, it compares between Network-based models and classical ElasticNet approach. It also performs a stability study on the selected variables.
* `OptimalVariableSize.Rmd`: Performs cross-validation on multiple values of `alpha` and shows Kaplan-Meier estimators and Concordance C-Index values.
* `Normalization_tests.Rmd`: Test different methods to normalize the data and then performs cross-validation to help decide on which to use.
